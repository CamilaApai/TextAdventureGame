# Overview

This project centers around developing a text adventure game using C#. Within this game, players will encounter various options and must choose their path wisely. Each decision they make will lead to different outcomes, and a wrong choice could result in the player's demise, leading to a game over scenario.

The primary goal is to deliver an engaging and interactive gaming experience within the C# environment, demonstrating integration with Visual Studio Code and GitHub.

In the text adventure game, players navigate through different scenarios by selecting from available options. It's crucial to choose carefully, as a wrong decision may lead to the player's death and ultimately, game over.
